## 1. Overview
There are three actors. The user, the dinning service staff and the delivery person. The user must first log onto the system using their messiah email. The user will then enter their location on campus and pick food from the provided menu. The user will then confirm their order and will receive the live location of the food. The dinning service staff will receive the order and will prepare the food. The delivery person must then take the food and deliver it to the user. Once the food arrives to the user the delivery person will confirm having delivered the food and the user must also confirm receiving the food. The user must then pay and the dinning service staff will accept the payment.
